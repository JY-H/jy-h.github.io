title: Hey there.
---
I'm Jiayan, a SWE based in NYC. I work on backend things and enjoy reading about distributed systems research.

I spend most of the time I'm not working on boxing.

I like learning the whys and hows behind things and sharing the knowledge with others. This page is my personal journey with the two things I know and love, and their intersections with everyday life.

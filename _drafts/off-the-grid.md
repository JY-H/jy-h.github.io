### December 14th, 2020
Since the start of quarantine, my friend Callie and I have been checking in with each other on an almost daily basis. From the trend of our recent check-ins, it became gradually evident to me that I have been making time for everything and everyone, except for myself. I am doing what I have to do (eat, sleep, stay employed), what I think I have to do (things like keeping up conditioning for training purposes), and what others want or expect me to do.

But I am not making time for what _I_ genuinely want to do.

And to be honest, my mind feels so scattered that I am no longer certain of what I need. Callie and I discussed this, and since I plan on leaving the city for two weeks to spend the holiday season with family, it seems like a good time to simply drop off the grid. Since I still have to work during some of this time, here are some ground rules:
* Turn off phone.
* Assign personal sites the localhost loopback address so that they remain inaccessible.
* Turn off laptop outside of work hours. As an exception, I can use my laptop for scheduled calls / video chats / virtual game sessions with friends.

To help with what I anticipate to be severe withdrawal symptoms, I prepared myself with:
* A blank notebook and pen to journal with.
* A few good books from a variety of genres: A Promised Land. The Vanishing Half. The Midnight Library.
* Company of parental units who have absolutely no clue I am doing this. My mom has always wanted to learn to bake, so now is our time.

The intent is to try this for a week starting on December 18th, and if it goes well, continue into 2021. I will report back when it's done.

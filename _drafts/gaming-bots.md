Back in June of last year, Blizzard announced that it had suspended over [74,000](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/actions-taken-to-address-exploitative-gameplay/558339){:target="_blank"} _World of Warcraft Classic_ accounts that were found to be automating gameplay via botting. Bots attack the integrity of a game like WoW (stealing resources, inflating the server economy, monopolizing rare drops) that is built on time investment and patience. When I read this
announcement, I was, to some extent, amused. After all, the game has been around for over 16 years, yet the botting problem appears to be one of the same.

So I got curious. How do you build a bot for a game like World of Warcraft? What about aimbots for FPS games? This will likely be broken up into a series of posts because there's a lot of interesting shit to talk about. For now, we will go over the basics of memory scanning and editing.
